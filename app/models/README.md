# MODELS

**This directory is required. This is where you create your models**

Any model added to this folder is automatically imported into your models.
This project uses [sqlalchemy](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/) to handle
sql database connections. It also uses [flask-migrate](https://flask-migrate.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
to handle database migrations.
